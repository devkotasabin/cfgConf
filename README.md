# CFGConf

Welcome to CFGConf, a JSON-based language for visualizing Control Flow Graphs. It provides a simple and intuitive way to generate custom visualization for graphs. CFGConf is designed to make it convenient to generate quick and easy drawings of graphs that match the task at hand. With just a few lines of JSON code, you will be able to create graphs suited to your analysis requirements. With its domain-specific layout for visualizing loops and flexible ways to filter and collapse the graph, you will be able to visualize graphs without writing complicated program code to process the graph and generate the corresponding drawing.
